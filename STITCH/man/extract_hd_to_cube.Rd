}
\arguments{
\item{vcf_file}{path to VCF}

\item{ref}{path to reference fasta (required by GATK)}

\item{bcftools}{path to vcftools (or just "bcftools" if in path)}

\item{gatk_jar}{path to GATK jar}

\item{samples}{vector of sample names (or NULL for all)}

\item{pos}{pos matrix, a matrix with at least two columns where the first two columns are chrom and 1-based physical position, respectively. specifies which SNPs to extract (or NULL for all)}

\item{field}{What to get from the VCF. Default HD for haplotype dosages}
}
