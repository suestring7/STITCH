* v1.3.4

* v1.3.3
	* Fix bug that occured when the number of samples is similar to or less than nCores

	* Fix bug about loading reference haplotypes from X chromosome for male reference samples

* v1.2.5
	* Require samtools to be in PATH

* v1.2.4
	* Enable C++11 compilation
	* Fix bug where sample name from bam header was being grabbed from any line with @RG in it and not specifically lines starting with @RG
* v1.2.3
	* Fix bug where the central SNP in a read was random from SNPs in read and not the central SNP by position among SNPs in the read as it ought to have been
	* Fix bug where the final SNP from posfile wasn't being loaded from the sample BAMs and as a result not being imputed
	* Fix bug where reads split into 3+ pieces were not being properly handled (e.g. long reads where sections map to multiple locations)
	* Faster internal handling of cigar string
* v1.2.2
	* Reduce RAM footprint when loading reference haplotypes
	* Crash early if rsync is not in PATH

	* Can bundle together inputs to facilitate imputation of very large N. See inputBundleBlockSize
	* Example human data provided to showcase STITCH functionality. See examples script
